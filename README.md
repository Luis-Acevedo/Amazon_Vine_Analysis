## Paid Reviews Positivity Bias

Our company has been tasked with looking to see if there is a positivity bias for the paid vine reviews. We will do this by looking at one of 50 data sets provided and transforming our data.

## Analysis

- First we will focus on the analysis of the Vine Program. 
  
  * ![Vine_Program](https://github.com/Luis-Acevedo/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Data/Photos/Vine_Program.png)

  * There are a total of 94 paid reviews left from the company. With only 48 being a 5-star rating and accounting for 51% of the reviews.

- Next are the normal reviews left on the website.

  * [Regular_Review](https://github.com/Luis-Acevedo/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Data/Photos/Regular_Review.png)

  * There are a total of 40,471 reviews left on amazon that were not paid for. Of those we have 15,663 that are 5-star reviews accounting for 38.7% of the total reviews.

# Findings

While looking at our data there does not seem to be a positivity bias. When comparing the number of reviews the paid reviews are such a small percent they couldn't affect the bigger number of normal reviews. That being said the overall percentage of 5-star reviews was over 10% higher. With the current data we have our company can look at the 5 star levels as buckets. With those buckets compare the percentage per level compared to the total reviews. This would allow us to see if people participating in the Vine Program are more likely to leave a positive review. We would accomplish this by doing the same thing for the normal reviews and see if a significant change in percentage has occurred.
